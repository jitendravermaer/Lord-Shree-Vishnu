                        darkest times of Kali Yuga. His birth will be marked by extraordinary celestial phenomena - the

                        of flowers out of season. From childhood, Kalki will display supernatural abilities and divine

                        understand Kalki's thoughts and respond to his will without any verbal command. This divine
                        horse will have the power to traverse the three worlds - earth, heaven, and the netherworld -
                        enabling Kalki to pursue evil wherever it may hide. The horse will be adorned with celestial
                        ornaments and will shine with its own inner light. Together, Kalki and Devadatta will form an

                        Ratnamaru will be able to multiply itself into countless swords when needed, allowing Kalki to

                        will emit a brilliant light that will blind the forces of evil while providing clarity and
                        strength to the righteous. The very sound of the sword being unsheathed will strike terror into
